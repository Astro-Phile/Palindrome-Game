âœ¨For what's the use of your intellect if you can't think of sentence palindromes.

Welcome to THE PALINDROME GAME. It's our word checker and palindrome identifier program. This program allows users to enter a sentence, checks if each word in the sentence has meaning based on a provided dictionary file, and determines if the sentence is a palindrome.


Features-


Word Meaning Check: The program checks each word in the input sentence against a dictionary file to ensure that all words have valid meanings.
Palindrome Identification: It identifies whether the input sentence is a palindrome or not.
User Interaction: Provides user-friendly prompts for continuing or ending the program based on user input.
